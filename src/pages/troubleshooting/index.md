## Token Testing Script

[Test your tokens with this script](https://www.gavsto.com/secure-application-model-for-the-layman-and-step-by-step/)

This script does not test the CIPP configuration, only that the tokens 
you are pasting into this script are correct.  

It is possible that you may have pasted the tokens incorrectly into the 
deployment fields. 


## Refresh Secure Access Model Tokens

[Refresh your tokens with this script:](https://www.cyberdrain.com/automating-with-powershell-getting-new-secure-app-model-tokens/)

```powershell title="Update-SecureAcessModelTokens.ps1"
### User Input Variables ###

### Enter the details of your Secure Access Model Application below ###

$ApplicationId           = '<YOUR APPLICATION ID>'
$ApplicationSecret       = '<YOUR APPLICATION SECRET>' | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
$TenantID                = '<YOUR TENANT ID>'

### Splat Params required for Updating Refresh Token ###

$UpdateRefreshTokenParamaters = @{
    ApplicationID        = $ApplicationId
    ApplicationSecret    = $ApplicationSecret
    Tenant               = $TenantID
    Scopes               = 'https://api.partnercenter.microsoft.com/user_impersonation'
    Credential           = $credential
    UseAuthorizationCode = $true
}

### Splat Params required for Updating Exchange Refresh Token ###

$UpdateExchangeTokenParamaters = @{
    ApplicationID           = 'a0c73c16-a7e3-4564-9a95-2bdf47383716'
    Scopes                  = 'https://outlook.office365.com/.default'
    Tenant                  = $TenantID
    UseDeviceAuthentication = $true
}

### Create credential object using UserEntered(ApplicationID) and UserEntered(ApplicationSecret) ###

$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($ApplicationId, $ApplicationSecret)

### Create new Refresh Token using previously splatted paramaters ###

$token = New-PartnerAccessToken @UpdateRefreshTokenParamaters

### Create new Exchange Refresh Token using previously splatted paramaters ###

$Exchangetoken = New-PartnerAccessToken @UpdateExchangeTokenParamaters 

### Output Refresh Token and Exchange Refresh Token ###

Write-Host "================ Secrets ================"
Write-Host "`$ApplicationId         = $($applicationID)"
Write-Host "`$ApplicationSecret     = $($ApplicationSecret)"
Write-Host "`$TenantID              = $($tenantid)"
write-host "`$RefreshToken          = $($token.refreshtoken)" -ForegroundColor Blue

## Clear Token Cache

1. Go to CIPP
1. Go to Settings
1. Click on **Backend**
1. Click on **Go to Function App Configuration**

> e.g *RefreshToken*

1. Stop the app once more for 5 minutes then start it again. 

The token cache should be cleared

## Service Principal

Sometimes Azure has intermittent issues with applying service principals to AAD.

If this is the only error during deployment, follow the below steps:

1. Go to the [Subscription in the Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade)
1. Click on **Access Control (IAM)**
1. Click **Add**
1. Click on **Add Role Assignment**
1. Give the Azure function service principal *reader* role

## Private Endpoint

To protect CIPP as a private resource, that is only accessible over a VPN or IP
whitelisting you can use Private Endpoint Connections. 

To enable Private Endpoints you must already have an Azure VNET available, and understand how VNET  work. 

1. Go to CIPP
1. Go to Settings
1. Click on **Backend**
1. Click on **Go to role management**
1. Click on **Private Endpoints**
1. Click on **Add**
1. Setup your vnet information

CIPP is now no longer internet accessible

## Conditional Access

To add Conditional Access to CIPP, follow the below steps:

1. Go to your [Conditional Access Policies](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ConditionalAccessBlade/Policies)
1. Select which users to apply the policy to, default suggestion is *"All Users"*
1. Click on **Azure Static Web Apps** as the included app under "Cloud Apps or actions"
1. Configure any condition you want. 

> e.g Trusted Locations, specific IPs, specific platforms, etc

1. At Access Controls you must enable *Grant, with MFA access*.
1. Click on **Save**

Your app is now protected with Conditional Access.

## Admin Consent

If you Azure Tenant requires admin approval for user apps, add consent by 
following the below steps:

1. Go to to [Azure Enterprise Applications](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/AllApps)
1. Find *Azure Static Websites*
1. Grant Admin Consent for all

This will allow the users the ability to grant their own access now
